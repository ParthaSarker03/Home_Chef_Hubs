# HomeChefHum
 
In today's fast-paced world, more people are seeking healthy, fresh, and homemade meals over processed food. Homemade dishes not only offer a healthier alternative, as they are made with fresh ingredients, but they are also more budget-friendly compared to restaurant meals. Additionally, home cooking creates income opportunities for local chefs, allowing them to earn a living while sharing their culinary talents.  

Our app simplifies the process for busy individuals to order homemade food, making it more accessible and convenient. By supporting local cooks and sourcing fresh ingredients, we also contribute to reducing food waste and promoting a more sustainable food ecosystem.
